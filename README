testtrack_to_jira.rb

testtrack_to_jira is a ruby script to help migrate data exported from Seapine
Software's TestTrack Pro (http://www.seapine.com/ttpro.html).  

This script looks through the XML file exported from TestTrack and publishes
those issues into JIRA through JIRA's SOAP API.  This script only works for
Open issues. Currently, this script:

* Preserves the TestTrack Defect Summary and prepends the Test Track
	Defect # for back reference
* Preserves the TestTrack Description
* Saves all history of an issue as comments to the JIRA issue
* Assigns all issues to the user specified in the configuration file

It DOES NOT:

* Preserve priorities, assignees, attachments, states
* Import closed or any-other non-open issues

Running the Script
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
You will need to have jira4r (http://jira4r.rubyhaus.org/)installed to use this 
script.  to install jira4r you need to run the following commands: 

$ git clone git://git.rubyhaus.org/jira4r-git.git
$ cd jira4r-git
$ gem build jira4r.gemspec
$ sudo gem install *.gem


You will also need a configuration file in your home directory named:

Once the prerequisites have been satisfied, running the migration is as simple
as typing:

$ ./testtrack_to_jira.rb
